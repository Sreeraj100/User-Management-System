# FRONTEND DEEP DIVE EXPLANATION
# Folder: /frontend

This document explains exactly how the Frontend (React application) works, step-by-step. Imagine you are the user clicking buttons.

---

## 1. THE STARTING POINT
When you open the website (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`), the browser loads:
1.  **`index.html`**: The wrapper file. It has a `<div id="root"></div>`.
2.  **`src/main.jsx`**: React takes control here.
    *   It grabs that `root` div.
    *   It wraps your entire app in `<Provider store={store}>`. This gives every component access to the "Global Memory" (Redux).
    *   Finally, it loads `<App />`.

---

## 2. NAVIGATION & ROUTING (`src/App.jsx`)
This file acts like a Traffic Controller. It looks at the URL bar.
*   **URL `/login`** -> It loads the **Login Component**.
*   **URL `/register`** -> It loads the **Register Component**.
*   **URL `/dashboard`** -> It loads the **Dashboard Component**, BUT inside a `<PrivateRoute>`.
    *   **PrivateRoute Check**: "Is the user logged in?"
        *   **YES**: Show Dashboard.
        *   **NO**: Stop! Redirect them to `/login`.

## 3. SCENARIO: A USER LOGS IN
Let's trace what happens when you try to log in.

### Step A: The User Types
You are on the **Login Page** (`src/pages/Login.jsx`).
1.  You type your email and password.
2.  **`react-hook-form`** watches every keystroke. It checks: "Is this empty? Is this a valid email?"
3.  If you leave it empty, it shows red text: "Email is required".

### Step B: The User Clicks "Login"
1.  You click the button.
2.  The form runs `onSubmit`.
3.  It calls `dispatch(login(userData))`. This is a Redux command.
    *   **Translation**: "Hey Redux, please start the 'login' process with this email and password."

### Step C: The API Call (`src/features/auth/authService.js`)
1.  The Redux action calls the **Service**.
2.  The Service uses `axios`. It sends a `POST` request to `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login`.
3.  It waits for the backend to reply.

### Step D: Storing the Result (`src/features/auth/authSlice.js`)
1.  **If Backend says "OK"**:
    *   It sends back a `token` and user info.
    *   Redux updates its state: `isLoading` becomes `false`, `isSuccess` becomes `true`, and `user` is filled with your data.
    *   The Token is saved to `localStorage` (so you stay logged in even if you refresh).
2.  **If Backend says "Error"** (e.g., Wrong password):
    *   Redux updates state: `isError` becomes `true`.
    *   The Login page sees `isError` is true and shows a red alert box.

### Step E: Redirect
1.  Inside `Login.jsx`, there is a `useEffect` hook. It's constantly watching the Redux state.
2.  The moment `isSuccess` becomes `true`, it runs `navigate('/dashboard')`.
3.  You are magically moved to the Dashboard page!

## 4. SCENARIO: THE DASHBOARD PAGE (`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
Now you are logged in.

### Step A: Loading Data
1.  When the page loads, `useEffect` runs immediately.
2.  It sends a `GET` request to the Backend to fetch your profile.
3.  **Crucial Step**: It attaches the **Token** (from Redux) to the request header.
    *   Header: `Authorization: Bearer <your-secret-token>`
    *   Without this, the backend would block the request.

### Step B: Editing Profile
1.  You click "Edit Profile". A state variable `isEditing` turns `true`.
2.  React re-renders: The text disappears, and Input Boxes appear instead.
3.  You change your name and select a file.

### Step C: Saving Changes
1.  You click "Save".
2.  The code creates a `FormData` object (because files are special data).
3.  It sends a `PUT` request to `/api/users/profile`.
4.  If successful, the local state updates with the new name/image, and `isEditing` turns `false`. The view switches back to text.

## 5. SCENARIO: ADMIN DASHBOARD (`src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`)
This is similar to the user dashboard but more powerful.

### Features
*   **Search**: As you type in the search box, `useEffect` sees the `search` variable change. It *automatically* fires a new request to the backend with `?search=keyword`. This makes the filtering instant and dynamic.
*   **Delete**: When you click "Delete", it asks for confirmation. If yes, it sends a `DELETE` request with the user's ID. Then it re-fetches the list so the deleted user disappears immediately.

---

## 6. STYLING (`src/index.css`)
We don't use complex CSS frameworks here to keep it simple.
*   Everything is standard CSS.
*   We use **Classes** like `.btn`, `.form-control`, `.card`.
*   If you see `className="btn"`, you can just look in `index.css` to see exactly what styles are applied (color, padding, border-radius).

## SUMMARY
The Frontend is a cycle:
1.  **User acts**: Clicks or Types.
2.  **Dispatch**: We tell the specific function to run.
3.  **Request**: We ask the Backend for something.
4.  **Wait**: We show a "loading" state.
5.  **Update**: We get data, update the State, and React updates the screen.
