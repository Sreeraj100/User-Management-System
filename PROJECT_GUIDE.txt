# PROJECT EXPLANATION GUIDE
# User Management System (MERN Stack)

This guide explains how this project works in simple English. It covers every file and folder so you can understand the complete flow of the application.

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: HOW IT WORKS

This project is a **Web Application** that allows users to Register, Login, and Manage their Profiles. It also has an **Admin** side where an administrator can see all users, edit them, or delete them.

It uses the **MERN Stack**:
1.  **M**ongoDB: The database (where data is saved).
2.  **E**xpress: The backend framework (helps build the server).
3.  **R**eact: The frontend (what the user sees).
4.  **N**ode.js: Runs the backend server.

### How they talk to each other:
1.  The **Frontend (React)** shows a form (like "Login").
2.  The User types data and clicks "Submit".
3.  The Frontend sends this data to the **Backend (Express)**.
4.  The Backend checks the data and interacts with **MongoDB**.
5.  The Backend sends a response (Success/Error) back to the Frontend.
6.  The Frontend handles the response (e.g., Redirects to Dashboard or shows an error).

## 2. BACKEND FOLDER (`/backend`)
The backend is the "brain" of the application. It runs on the server.

### **Server File**
*   **`server.js`**: This is the **start point** of the backend.
    *   **What it does**: It starts the server, connects to the MongoDB database, and tells the server which "routes" (URL paths) to use for different features.
    *   **Why needed**: Without this, the backend application essentially doesn't exist. It's the engine.

### **Models Folder** (`/backend/models`)
*   **`User.js`**:
    *   **What it does**: It defines the **Structure (Schema)** of a user in the database. It basically says: "Every user must have a name (String), an email (String), a password (String), and a profile image."
    *   **Why needed**: To enforce rules on what data can be saved.

### **Controllers Folder** (`/backend/controllers`)
These files contain the actual logic or "functions" that run when a specific route is visited.
*   **`authController.js`**: Handles **Authentication**.
    *   `registerUser`: Checks if user exists, encrypts password, creates user.
    *   `loginUser`: Checks email/password, generates a "Token" (passkey) for the user.
    *   `loginAdmin`: Checks if the email/password matches the Admin credentials in the `.env` file.
*   **`userController.js`**: Handles **User features**.
    *   `getMe`: Gets the current user's info.
    *   `updateProfile`: Allows a user to change their name, email, or photo.
*   **`adminController.js`**: Handles **Admin features**.
    *   `getUsers`: Lists all users.
    *   `deleteUser`: Removes a user from the database.
    *   `updateUserByAdmin`: Allows admin to change a user's details.

### **Routes Folder** (`/backend/routes`)
These files act like traffic signs. They point URL addresses to the Controller functions.
*   **`authRoutes.js`**: Maps URLs like `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` to the `authController`.
*   **`userRoutes.js`**: Maps `/api/users/profile` to functions that update the profile.
*   **`adminRoutes.js`**: Maps `/api/admin/users` to functions that list or delete users.

### **Middleware Folder** (`/backend/middleware`)
*   **`authMiddleware.js`**: This is the **Security Guard**.
    *   **What it does**: It checks every request to a "protected" route. It looks for a **Token** (JWT). If the token is valid, it lets the request pass; otherwise, it stops it.
    *   **Why needed**: To make sure only logged-in users can access the Dashboard.

## 3. FRONTEND FOLDER (`/frontend`)
The frontend is the "face" of the application. It runs in the user's browser.

### **Key Config Files**
*   **`package.json`**: Lists all tools (libraries) we installed, like `react`, `axios`, `redux`.
*   **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration for **Vite**, the tool that runs and bundles our React app (makes it fast).

### **Source Folder** (`/frontend/src`)

#### **Bootstrapping**
*   **`main.jsx`**: The starting point of React. It grabs the HTML element with id `root` and puts our React app inside it. It also sets up **Redux** (state management).
*   **`App.jsx`**: Handles **Routing**. It decides which Page to show based on the URL (e.g., if URL is `/login`, show Login Page).
*   **`index.css`**: The main style sheet. It contains all the design, colors (variables), and classes that make the app look good.

#### **Redux (State Management)** (`/features/auth`)
We use Redux to remember if the user is logged in, so we don't lose that info when switching pages.
*   **`authSlice.js`**: This is like a global "Memory".
    *   **What it does**: It holds the state: `user` (logged in data), `isLoading` (spinner), `isError` (if something failed). It updates this memory when we Login, Register, or Logout.
*   **`authService.js`**: This is the **Messenger**.
    *   **What it does**: It uses `axios` to actually send HTTP requests to our Backend API. The `authSlice` calls this service to get data.

#### **Pages Folder** (`/pages`)
These are the full screens the user sees.
*   **`Login.jsx` & `Register.jsx`**:
    *   **What they do**: Show forms. They use `react-hook-form` to validate inputs (check if empty). When submitted, they ask Redux to "login" or "register".
*   **`Dashboard.jsx`**:
    *   **What it does**: The private area for a user. It fetches profile data from the backend and lets the user edit their info or upload a photo.
*   **`AdminLogin.jsx`**: A special login page just for the admin.
*   **`AdminDashboard.jsx`**:
    *   **What it does**: Shows a table of all users. Allows the Admin to search, edit, or delete any user.

#### **Components Folder** (`/components`)
*   **`PrivateRoute.jsx`**: A security wrapper for the frontend. If a user tries to go to `/dashboard` but isn't logged in, this component kicks them back to `/login`.
*   **`AdminRoute.jsx`**: Similar to above, but specifically checks if the user is an **Admin**.

## 4. EXAMPLE FLOWS

### **Flow 1: User Registration**
1. User goes to `/register`.
2. User types name, email, password.
3. **`Register.jsx`** checks if fields are valid.
4. If valid, it dispatches `register` action in **`authSlice.js`**.
5. **`authSlice`** calls **`authService`**, which sends data to Backend (`/api/auth/register`).
6. **`server.js`** sends data to **`authRoutes.js`**, which sends it to **`authController.js`**.
7. **`authController`** creates user in MongoDB and returns a Token.
8. Frontend receives Token, saves it in **Redux** and **LocalStorage**.
9. User is redirected to Dashboard.
